**Investor Profile:** Moderately dynamic  
**Target Annual Return:** 5.5–6% (base case), up to 8% (favorable scenario)  
**Target Volatility:** 8–10%  
**Sharpe Ratio Target:** ≥ 0.6

## 2. Strategic Allocation
| Asset Class | Instrument / ETF | Weight | Objective |
|--------------|------------------|---------|------------|
| Global Equities | MSCI World UCITS ETF | 18% | Core portfolio exposure |
| European Equities | iShares Core MSCI Europe | 11% | Regional diversification |
| Quality Dividend Equities | iShares MSCI World Quality Dividend | 9% | Defensive yield |
| Asia-Pacific ex-Japan | Lyxor MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan | 7% | Emerging growth exposure |
| Bonds (EUR/US 1–5Y) | iShares Euro Gov 1–5yr & US Treasury 1–5yr | 22% | Stability & smoothing |
| Inflation-linked Bonds | iShares $ TIPS UCITS 1–5yr | 11% | Real yield protection |
| Physical Gold | iShares Physical Gold | 11% | Safe haven hedge |
| US Real Estate | Vanguard US Real Estate ETF | 11% | Diversification & yield |
| EUR Money Market | EUR Money Market ETF | variable | Temporary holding allocation |

---

## 3. Macro Framework
| Theme | View | Expected Impact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Global Growth | Moderate | Neutral positioning on equities |
| Inflation | Sticky core | Supports quality and defensive equities |
| Monetary Policy | Restrictive but peaking | Favors short-duration bonds |
| USD Cycle | Structurally strong | Maintains unhedged USD exposure |
| Emerging Markets | Delayed recovery | Gradual exposure via DCA strategy |

---

## 4. Progressive Deployment (DCA)
The portfolio will be deployed through a **three-phase Dollar Cost Averaging strategy** between **November 2025 and May 2026**, to optimize entry timing during a late-cycle environment.

- **Nov 2025 – Phase 1 (40%)**: Initial allocation amid the AI correction and valuation compression.  
- **Feb 2026 – Phase 2 (30%)**: Added exposure as credit conditions normalize and markets anticipate a monetary pivot.  
- **May 2026 – Phase 3 (30%)**: Final exposure once macro recovery signals and market liquidity improve.  

**Objectives:**
- Lower average entry price.  
- Reduce volatility on entry.  
- Achieve full exposure by **Q2 2026**, aligning with early-cycle acceleration.

---

## 5. Risk & FX Management
- **Maximum Drawdown:** ~15% (historical modeled scenario).  
- **Rebalancing Rule:** Maintain target weights ±5%.  
- **Currency Exposure:** ≈ 40% USD unhedged.  
- **Reason:** Real rate differentials remain favorable to the USD (Fed ~4% vs ECB ~2.15%).  
- **Long-term View:** Structural bearish bias on EUR/USD over the next 5 years.  

FX hedging will be reconsidered in **Q2 2026**, depending on policy shifts and yield differentials.

---

- French *Livret Jeune* (4% net yield, capped)  
- EUR Money Market ETF (3.8–4% gross yield, volatility <0.2%)  

Reallocation planned toward **US REITs** in **mid-2026**, once long-term rates stabilize and the Fed pivot materializes.
